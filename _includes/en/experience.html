                    <em>Virtual Reality</em>. Such tasks involved testing different AR solutions and the development of
                    a mini tutorial for the VR Headset <b>Oculus Quest</b> using Unity Engine.

                    Development of a web solution for the administration of the grading system at a high school. I
                    designed and built the database while also working on the back-end using PHP. This was a project
                    developed for the class of Software Engineering; 5 teams delivered their solutions, and of all the
                    projects, my team was chosen as the best solution.
